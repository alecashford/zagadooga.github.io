			My plan for this website is to make it be the nexus on which I can submit all of my other content that I will be producing for DBC. I also plan on eventually getting it hosted, so it can be independent of github; I want it to be the place where I can post my blog (because I don't want to use a conventional blogging platform like tumblr or wordpress), link to my projects, and have an "about me" section that will tell my story to the world and possibly to future employers. I'm starting off my design simple, as my design sensibilites are minimalist and in my experience the eye is made to feel comfortable by negative space. My priority is to make the design attractive and make the navigation extremely easy. As I move one, I may even put a slideshow on the front page.
