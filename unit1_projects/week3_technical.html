		<h2>Week 3: Technical Blog - April 20, 2014</h2>
		<p>
			Javascript is a fairly general purpose and relatively easy to use object-oriented programming language, but this does not entirely account for its popularity as the lingua franca of front-end web development. As the only scripting language that can be interpreted by web browsers, it is mostly used to create dynamic elements in webpages that work without having to refresh the page. It caught on early and has since become the only universally agreed upon language for these purposes in-browser. I am not fully convinced that it would have gained the level of prominence it has achieved without that early boost, nor do I believe that it is the best language for all in-browser programming;  a more ideal scenario would be if most mainstream browsers could interpret multiple different scripting languages, just as most operating systems can.<br><br>

			All that said, I don’t believe that javascript’s current popularity is an accident of history, nor do I believe it will be disappearing anytime soon. While I suppose it could theoretically be used for both back-end and front-end programming, it is most popular in the front-end, and it is here where I believe it excels. Javascript is fairly light, so it does not bog down browsers with having to interpret code. I also find it to be a straightforward language, with relatively easy to understand syntax. Languages are considered either high-level or low-level; the higher the level a language is, the more distant it becomes from the internal working languages of the physical computer. Low level languages are not intuitive, they are designed mostly for the convenience of the computer, and are thus difficult to understand by humans, even if they are easier for the hardware to digest. High-level languages, on the other hand, are easier to read and work in, but are going to be somewhat more taxing for the computer to turn into action. Javascript is a high-level computer language, but strikes a balance between readability and performance; it is not quite as high as, say, ruby or python, but it is higher than C, a low-level language, with which it shares many syntactical similarities.</p>
