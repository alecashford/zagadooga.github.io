		<h2>Week 3: Technical Blog - April 20, 2014</h2>
		<p>
			Javascript is a fairly general purpose and relatively easy to use object-oriented programming language, but this does not entirely account for its popularity as the lingua franca of web development. It is used to create dynamic elements in webpages without having to refresh the page, with the back-end server and transmuting and receiving data seamlessly, which it uses to alter the content of the webpage. Rather, it has caught on, over the years and especially so recently, because it gained purchase early on as the only in-HTML scripting language that can be interpreted by the browser. I am not fully convinced that it would have gained the level of prominence it has achieved without that early boost, nor do I believe that it is the best language for all in-browser programming;  a more ideal scenario would be if most mainstream browsers could interpret multiple different scripting languages, just as most operating systems can.<br><br>

			All that said, I don’t believe that javascript’s current popularity is an accident of history, nor do I believe it will be disappearing anytime soon. While I suppose it could theoretically be used for both back-end and front-end programming, it is most popular with the front-end, and it is here that I believe it excels. Javascript is fairly light, so it does not bog down browsers with having to interpret code. I also find it to be a straightforward language, with relatively easy to understand syntax. Languages are considered either high-level or low-level; the higher the level a language is, the more distant it becomes from the internal working languages of the physical computer. Low level languages are not intuitive, they are designed mostly for the convenience of the computer, and are thus difficult to understand by humans, even if they are easier for the hardware to compute. High-level languages, on the other hand, are easier to read and work in, and are going to be somewhat more taxing for the computer to digest and turn into action. Javascript is a high-level computer language, but strikes a balance between readability and performance. It is not quite as high as, say, ruby or python, but it is higher than C, a low-level language, which it shares many syntactical similarities with.</p>
