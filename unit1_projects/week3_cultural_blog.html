		<h2>Week 3: Technical Blog - April 20, 2014</h2>
		<p>
			A large part of the DBC experience is pair programming. In phase 0, we have been pairing through online media, making heavy use of google hangouts and styli sheets. These are somewhat clumsy methods of collaborating, as it is far more ideal to be in the same room with each other, and being able to read their body language and hear them think out loud right next to you, but it serves as an adequate proxy to pairing in real life.<br><br>

	I have, so far, found pairing enjoyable and productive. Although I enjoy working on problems by myself, I have been pleasantly surprised at how efficient it is to collaborate on a problem with another person. I find the process of relating to that person to be fairly straightforward, and the benefits are considerable. When you pair, you get stuck on problems far less frequently, and you get more done in a shorter amount of time.<br><br>

	Unfortunately, I have not received any feedback through the Socrates medium at the time of writing this blog post (late Sunday evening).</p>
