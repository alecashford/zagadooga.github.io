		<h2>Week 2: Technical Blog - April 11, 2014</h2>
		<p>
			I am currently at the end of week 2 of the Dev Bootcamp phase 0, the nine-week lead up that gets us up to speed before we begin the course in ernest. The information we got from DBC estimated that we should be spending 10-15 hours per week on the material, but my experience, and the experience of my accountability group, has been that this is a low estimate. To really do justice to the material, it takes a significant time commitment to tinker with what we’ve been learning. It also helps to write about the material we’ve learned as if to a non-technical audience, because it’s been rightly said that if you can’t explain something simply, your don’t really understand it at all.<br><br>

			So far week 2 has been a whirlwind of HTML, CSS, and graphical design concepts. In just two weeks, we’ve learned the fundamentals of web design by jumping head first into getting a website online, and practicing the new concepts by directly implementing them into our code. My understanding of HTML and CSS is that they are not similar to the object-oriented programming languages I am most familiar with; rather, they are simply a text-based representation of graphical aspects on a web page. These aspects are compartmentalized in self-contained tags, that break up the content on the page and organize them based on class and id names. You can id a certain tag—say, one header—and change the style of that header alone by referencing it by name in the CSS sheet. The same is true, conceptually, of classes, but differ in that they do not reference one element specifically but rather any element that is marked as a part of that class.

			Without CSS all webpages would look the same, as they would all be interpreted through the browser’s default style setting. But that would make for a very boring surfing experience! That is why we use CSS, which is distinct from HTML but inextricably linked to it, to change the look of our websites and make them look good. CSS can be entered in an HTML file manually, but the best practice is to have a separate CSS sheet that the HTML merely links to, so that one website could have, theoretically, many HTML pages but only one CSS sheet, resulting in a uniform look and feel of the website, because every pages shares the same style.

			All elements in a web page are built on a concentric box model, with elements and the space between them being able to be placed customized. Each element can be thought of as an independent box. In CSS we refer to three parts that surround the content, listed here from the inside out:</p>
			<ul>
			<li>Content</li>
			<li>Padding</li>
			<li>Border</li>
			<li>Margin</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Padding is blank space around the content that can be used to place it more precisely on the page. The border is on the next level out but can be made to exhibit color, such as if you desire an outline or frame for your content. Then finally is the margin, which is another layer of blank space, this time outside of the border.<br><br>

			You can position elements in CSS on a relative, fixed, and absolute basis. The differences between these are fairly intuitive: relative means an element is fixed relative to its default position, fixed means it is fixed at a precise spot in the browser window, and absolute means the element is fixed relative to its parent element.<br><br>

			Some element tags are given default line breaks after them. For example, all header tags do not need to include and extra break after they are closed, as a line break is inferred by the browser. These elements are called inline elements. A block element is one that is treated as one solid block, with some space above and below it, and nothing allowed to the left or right of it. Finally, an inline block is an element that mixes aspects of both of these: it is treated as a block element, but placed as an inline element.

			An entire other subject that is too detailed to squeeze in this brief primer but I may save for a separate blog post since I find it especially fascinating is responsive web design. In a nutshell, responsive web design is the art of building a website so that it is legible and attractive on any screen size, from extremely large monitors to mobile devices. I will certainly write more about this as I get more deeply into it.</p>
