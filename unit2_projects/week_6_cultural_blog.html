			According to wikipedia, stereotype threat is “the experience of anxiety in a situation in which a person has the potential to confirm a negative stereotype about his or her social group.” This may cause people to check their behavior in a way they wouldn’t otherwise, and is generally an indication that that person is a member of a minority group with certain negative stereotypes associated with them. However, I believe that any person can be stereotyped based on superficial qualities, and made to feel like they are expected to play a particular role in society or amongst their peers. Humans, by nature, categorize everything. Even language is an attempt to categorize objects with infinite diversity between individual instances (tree, house, dog) and boil them down to one word descriptions. My contention, therefore, would be that we fall into the trap of wanting to categorize other people using the only variables that set them apart to use that are immediately apparent: race, sex, attractiveness, hair color, dress, etc. Each of these things have various stereotypes associated with them, and while some groups have been traditionally more stereotyped than others, I believe that nearly every group has stereotypes, positive and negative, associated with them.<br><br>

			Sometimes I feel awkward speaking about privilege, as a white male. I belong to a social group that, at least in the United States, is traditionally viewed as being at the apex of social privilege. However, I believe that looking at someone, assuming that they live a privileged life, and drawing conclusions about their character because of that is a harmful assumption. Unfortunately, this is very common, and ironically prevalent among the types of people that typically discourage stereotyping based on race and gender. These are complex issues and so, when I meet someone, I try to abstain from making judgements on their character until I’ve gotten to know them on a personal level. In my opinion, this is the only way to counter stereotype threat. I’m not saying it is not ok to categorize the people we know; as I have said, man is naturally predisposed to categorizing, but we run into danger when we presume to know things about other people drawing from superficial qualities, and we should avoid drawing conclusions about someone’s character from these qualities at all costs.</p>
