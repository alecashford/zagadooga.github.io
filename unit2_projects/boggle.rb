#Reflection:
#The greatest thing this exercise taught me was how to use nested arrays.
#I was not positive how to use them initially and I am glad that I leaned
#Ruby's way of treating them. They seem very useful for creating lists within
#lists that are highly related to each other, although I would be a little
#hesitant to use them in any other situation.
