		<h2>Week 4: Cultural Blog - April 23, 2014</h2>
		<p>
			I generally try to prevent conflict, but there are instances in my life where this has been impossible. I find that the instances some of my relationships have been the most strained are between me and my roommates. Often it is easy to be lured into believing that, since you are all good friends with someone, that that will translate into a good living situation. However, this is often very far from the truth: in my experience, the things that made you friends to begin with start to get on your nerves after a few months, and some traits of they personalities you were not even aware of before you lived together come out in that context.<br><br>

			Conflict arises naturally, and a near-universal truth is that conflict rarely 	solves anything apart from making someone feel better, like they said their bit and got out all their grief and they can get on with being friends. It is not always the case that a relationship is able to return to normal after a big fight. I remember a particular fight with a particular roommate that started over something that was, in retrospect, fairly trivial; suffice to say that it was more a case of a selfish act after a trend of selfish acts that proved to be “the straw that broke the camel’s back.” Neither of us, myself very much included, handled the fight well, so it escalated very quickly. It was fought entirely with words but, as we all know, words can be very hurtful. The fight quickly become, not about the thing that started it, but about every complaint we could remember having about the other person. In the moment, this made the situation worse and worse until we had to agree simply to walk away and stew on the issues by ourselves.<br><br>

			I took about 20 minutes alone and realized that even if I was right, insisting that other people recognize that was not going to really help my situation. It was a big epiphany, because I realized that, in order to have a healthy living environment with people who, at that point, I really had no choice about living with, it was more important to maintain good relations than it was to make them change their ways, or try to assert my authority. It was then that, fully aware that he would not return it, I apologized. And you know what? I was right. He accepted my apology but didn’t offer one of his own, which I was ok with, because I wrote it off as just part of who he was and that his good aspects outnumbered his bad ones.<br><br>

			If I were to go back, I’m honestly not sure that I would have done anything different, because if I had not had this unpleasant experience, I would not have come to that valuable realization that I have applied, with great success, to other people in other areas of my life!</p>
