			Functional programming “is a style of programming which models computation as the evaluation of expressions.” Something that is helpful to remember when trying to understand the difference between the functional paradigm and the object oriented (OO) paradigm is the fact that what are known as methods in ruby are known as “functions” in many other programming languages. Data is sent between functions, and is manipulated in complicated ways. With this in mind, it is a little easier to pinpoint just what functional programming is, and where it excels: functional programming is great when you have a set amount of data and want to do complicated things to it. For example, while OO languages are great for most software and development applications, it would not be a very elegant tool for carrying out complicated statistical analysis. This is why, in the world of engineering and hard-science analytics, functional programming languages are king. In some ways they are easier to understand as there are no mind-bending OO concepts to digest, but in other ways the operations they conduct are far more complex.<br><br>

			I do not really consider functional languages to be the opposite of OO programming by nature, as most OO languages have functional aspects built into them; however their use is limited, and their primary function is to serve objects. A serious data scientist would be well served by knowing both OO and functional languages.
