#This was a difficult challenge for me mostly because it took a while for me
#to devise an effective method to divide up people so that no group would ever
#be the same, and so that no student would ever be with the same people twice.
#The key insight, for me, was to split them up into four arrays and use their
#position within the arrays to generate the groups. By shifting the position of
#each person just one over in the arrays, you could ensure complete randomness
#between the groups without actually being random: it is a methodical method to
#ensure diversity. I found this challenge technically challenging since I had to
#learn a lot of the most important concepts along the way. For example, I did not
#understand the purpose of the $ in ruby until I complete this challenge.
