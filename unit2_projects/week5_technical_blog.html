		Ruby is an object oriented programming language, which means that it deals in virtual “objects” as its most fundamental component. An object, in the context of an object oriented programming language, can be understood, by analogy, to be very similar to a real world object, with intrinsic properties and associations that define what it is and make it unique. For example, you can create a person object, which may be assigned many different properties, such as age, weight, hair color, eye color, and name, but that object will always be a person. In object-oriented programming, this distinction, between properties an object has, and properties an object is, has quite a lot of importance.<br><br>

		Most object oriented languages take this concept and extend it to make it more flexible. In ruby, for example, you can create “classes” which feed information into the class template and create an entirely unique object, with the information you passed into it upon it’s creation being its fundamental properties. To extend our person analogy, you could create a new instance of class “person” and then add parameters, such as the ones mentioned above, which will become intrinsic properties of this new person object and can be called upon at any time.<br><br>

		The usefulness of classes cannot be understated. They are a vital part of managing complex sets of data effectively, and are used almost everywhere. Say, for example, you are a hospital administrator and run a database of patients and all of their information and medical records. You would probably want to have a separate object for every patient, with different data fields representing the hundreds of different details that can be collected about a patient and their health. You would want their name, their social security number, insurance information, address, as well as the results of all tests conducted at that hospital contained within it. You could, if you wanted, choose to code up an individual object with all of that information hard-coded inside of it, but that would take forever if you had a lot of records to produce. It would be much easier if you could just create one template which would generate an instance object of class patient that contained all of your relevant information, and pass the patient’s information into it. That is exactly the purpose of having a custom method to create an instance of a class.
