	What exactly is ruby on rails? The alliteration sounds cool, but the name does little to give away what it actually does. Simple put, rails is a web application framework run on the ruby programming language. However, this does not really answer what rails is or what it does. To do that we must break down the question a bit further.<br><br>

First, what is a web app, or application? Well, it’s an application that is hosted online, but it differs from a webpage. A webpage is entirely static and nonfunctional. It can contain text, graphics, and videos, but it can’t do anything at all. If you want your webpage to be able to do anything useful, you’re going to need to be able to use a dynamic language such as ruby to run on the server in your back end and interact with your webpage. For example, if you have a shopping cart for your online store, you can’t just have a picture of a shopping cart or tell the page it’s your shopping cart page. Computers are not very smart and you’re going to be specific and tell the computer exactly what to do.<br><br>

Now, a framework is a package that selectively changes software or a computer language to provide unique features or specific functionality. If you are familiar with the concept of a plugin, that is sort of what a framework is like. You are enhancing, or changing, the way a computer language functions, retrofitting it and optimizing it to perform a certain task. So, what is ruby on rails? It is a bundle of extra features that can enhance ruby and optimize it for the creation of web applications.
