		<h2>Week 5: Cultural Blog - May 4, 2014</h2>
		<p>
			Net neutrality is the concept that all data is treated the same way by all parties involved in the distribution of the internet. It is, in all honesty, a mixed blessing for tech as an industry, industry as a whole, and perhaps for society in general, because it has allowed for a "wild west" online, where almost anything is allowed and almost anything can be found with a few keystrokes and minimal effort. The internet is rife with vices and disturbing content, including easy pornography, gambling, real and graphic depictions of death, and in some places, identity theft, prostitution, and drugs. Internet piracy is another issue, as it allows media that had previously been in control of record labels and movie studios to be freely distributed, effectively eliminating the profit motive to produce these works. Law enforcement, completely overwhelmed by the amount of new criminals they could be chasing, choose only to focus on the most heinous, with the rest being reluctantly tolerated, at least for now.<br><br>
 
			However, all of this must be checked in order to for me to turn around and say that on the whole, net neutrality is good for society and threats against it are therefore bad. It has been demonstrated in countries that do police the net more strictly that they begin their arguments with appeals to decency, promising to reign in anti-social behaviors such as those mentioned above. However, while the protections are put in place for these reasons initially, they always end up being used to police thoughts and ideas rather than vices. State control over the internet has thus been associated with repressive regimes worldwide, who may have something to hide from their citizens and implicitly acknowledge they would have trouble maintaining control over their population if they did not control their access to information.<br><br>
 
			But aside from the freedom of speech and freedom of information arguments, there is the fact that corporations with a vested interest against keeping the internet fully free and open have begun pushing for laws that would allow them to be the gatekeepers of online content. While the Orwellianism of state-controlled internet service may frighten some, I think that possibility is negligible in comparison to the very real possibility that cable providers will start to exercise their already-existent monopolies to control the information that comes into our home and influence public opinion, as the government of the United States has proven much more willing to allow such behavior from corporations than it has been to engage in the behavior itself. The latest rulings in favor of Comcast, for example, allowing them to selectively throttle bandwidth from websites, such as streaming services like Netflix that compete with its own, comparable services, indicate the next battleground over net neutrality will be fought between industries, not between the citizens and their government.<br><br>
 
			This gets to the heart of why infringements upon net neutrality are bad for tech and bad for the economy. Anti-competitive behavior, when allowed by the government and society, hurt everyone except the monopoly-holder. New services that appear online often exist to fill voids that have not been filled by conventional business models. Profit remains to be made off of providing services online, and old-media corporations, doing, in all honesty, what any profit-driven entity would do, seek desperately to kill off these younger and more competitive upstarts that threaten their dominance. This is why a measure of commitment to neutrality is in the interest of the government, if it is indeed charged with maintaining the health of the economy, and at the very least, a public knowledge of the benefits to society a free internet ultimately has is essential, as it is ultimately the public that shapes the character of the government, and the public that will be most helped or harmed by the erosion of a free web.</p>
