		<h2>Week 8: Cultural Blog - May 25, 2014</h2>
		<p>
	There are a lot of things that Shereef said that I connect with, but I think much of it could be summed up ini one simple phrase: you will get out of the experience what you put in. Nothing more and nothing less. I connect with that because I feel that at no point in life should you become complacent. Nothing is ever going to be given to you in life, and everything that you need you must learn to take for yourself.<br><br>

Honestly, a lot of that really intimidates me. It would be, frankly, too good to be true to pay my tuition and be plugged into some magical machine that would upload programming knowledge directly into my brain. The real world doesn’t work like that. In the real world, you have to work for everything, and (almost) no one gets anything they don’t deserve. And that scares me. It scares me that I won’t be able to rise to the challenge. That I won’t be strong enough or resilient enough or powerful enough or smart enough. I haven’t been worried about that up until now, but now I am for some reason. It’s like I assumed I would be up to the challenge, but as soon as it comes close to being a reality, it starts to scare me.<br><br>

One thing that gives me comfort is the fact that I don’t seem to be out of sync with the rest of my cohort, that we are all on a similar skill level and we are all finding similar things challenging. Still, I don’t think any of us know what’s in store for us. I know that it is times of crisis that I seem to rise to challenges but I’ve never sustain a burst of energy as long as I will have to. I am excited but also nervous, and I think that is honestly the way it should be.
