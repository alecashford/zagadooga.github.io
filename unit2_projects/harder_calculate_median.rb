#This was a somewhat harder challenge, but was still fairly easy conceptually
#because we have done the same challenge just in a different language (javascript).
#Because of this, I did not find it too difficult to figure out how to transfer that
#concept into ruby, the only difference between the challenges was forcing floating
#point numbers instead of integers. It was also an important learning opportunity
#to use rspec, which I didn't fully understand until I used it for this challenge.
