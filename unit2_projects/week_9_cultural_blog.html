		<h2>Week 9: Cultural Blog - June 1, 2014</h2>
		<p>
	As far as giving feedback is concerned, I am a believer in the power of the compliment sandwich, which is to say, give one genuine compliment, then some constructive criticism, then another compliment. The reason this works is the human ego is a very tenuous and fragile thing. Most of us hate criticism, particularly on work we’ve done. When we complete work, it is, in some ways, an externalization of ourselves, and when someone else criticizes it, it is easy to feel personally attacked.<br><br>

Nevertheless, it is very important to render criticism sometimes. This is mostly because, as I’ve mentioned, our work is like ourselves, and sometimes we don’t see the obvious faults to ourselves or to our work. However, while work may need criticism, it must be given constructively. The difference between constructive criticism and malicious criticism is one is nonjudgmental and intended to improve the work, whereas malicious criticism is given to make that person feel better in comparison by putting down the work of someone else. This is a reaction grounded in insecurity and is not healthy at all.<br><br>

It is also important to end on a good not by giving another compliment. People are sometimes going to be in a tender place when they are criticized so it’s important to remind them of the positive aspects of what they’ve done, while also giving them something to work on.
