		<h2>Week 4: Technical Blog - April 24, 2014</h2>
		<p>
		For this week’s technical blog post, I will be answering two questions: what is the difference between an array and a hash? And, what are the various means of looping in ruby?

		I’ll start at the beginning. In ruby, you can store data in several different forms, and two of those forms are arrays and hashes. Arrays are lists of variable, either strings or integers (or even other arrays!), that are stored in a linear format, one after the other. They are extremely useful as a general purpose place to store information, and are extremely useful for iteration.<br><br>

		Then there are hashes. Hashes are very similar to dictionaries in python; they store paired values, which is why I think that python’s definition is a bit clearer. They are good for directly replacing one item with another, or for situations where you want one value inextricably linked to another.<br><br>

		Looping in ruby is very similar to other languages, especially languages that it shares syntactic similarities with. There is the For loop, which loops over a range of numbers or items in an array, and continues looping until it has run through them. Then there is the while loop, which will not stop looping until it fulfills specific criteria, such as “i >= 10”, and has the dangerous potential for getting stuck in an infinite loop. Finally there are several looping methods that I believe are unique to ruby, such as the “until” loop, which is similar to the while loop, just phrased as “until” something happens rather than “while” something is happening, and finally, the .each method, which simulates the functionality of the for loop, is written with different syntax.
