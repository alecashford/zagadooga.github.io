		<a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/"><strong>BBC News</strong></a><br>
		The problem this website is solving is that of straight news distribution, with little editorialization. They cultivate a reputation as a global outlet of reputable news, which is why they have news coverage from all over the world. The challenge visually is to cram a lot of information on the front page so you can get the gist of what's happening in the world at a glance, but avoid making the page overly cluttered.<br>

		The problem this site solves is interesting commentary on culture and current events. The design challenges are similar to the BBC, but they tackle it with a slideshow instead of multiple boxes. In my design I chose to play up this aspect, giving the slideshow more slides and making it bigger in proportion to the viewing area.

		<a href="http://www.reddit.com/"><strong>Reddit</strong></a><br>
		Reddit is a good place to find agregated content of whatever you're interested in. Because there are so many subreddits, however, it is challenging to find the one's that actually appeal to you. I would change this by making a larger "random" and "favorites" buttons, making them more integrated into the experience. If possible I would also add a "recommended" section but since that is not a part of the website currently I did not add it.
