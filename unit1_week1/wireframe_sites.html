		<a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/"><strong>BBC News</strong></a><br>
		The problem this website solves is that of straight news distribution, with little editorialization. They cultivate a reputation as a global outlet of reputable news, which is why they have news coverage from all over the world. The challenge visually is to cram a lot of information on the front page so you can get the gist of what's happening in the world at a glance, but avoid making the page overly cluttered. If I were to change it I would also add a map of the world, where you coul visually select where you want to focus, instead of selecting from tabs.<br><br>

		<a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/"><strong>The Atlantic</strong></a><br>
		The problem this site solves is providing interesting commentary on culture and current events. The design challenges are similar to the BBC, but they tackle it with a slideshow instead of multiple boxes. If I were to change it I would choose to play up this aspect, giving the slideshow more slides and making it bigger in proportion to the viewing area.

		<a href="http://www.reddit.com/"><strong>Reddit</strong></a><br>
		Reddit is a good place to find agregated content of whatever you're interested in. The design is fairly overwhelming and the experience is random. Because there are so many subreddits, however, it is challenging to find the ones that actually appeal to you. If I were to change it I would make a larger "random" and "favorites" buttons, making them more prominant in the experience.
