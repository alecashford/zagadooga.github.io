		<a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/"><strong>BBC News</strong></a><br>
		1. This is one of my favorite websites because it presents world and US news from a relatively unbiased point of view.<br>
		2. My eye is first drawn to the large headline in the middle of the page, which is probably intentional as it's the one deemed most important by the editorial staff.<br>
		3. Sleek, no-frills, engaging, official, professional.<br>
		4. The BBC provides quality, publicly funded news, and razor sharp analysis.<br>
		5. Practical, informative, incisive, measured, intelligent.<br>
		6. I find it quite easy to find what I'm looking for, as it has convenient tabs where you can sort the content based on the kind of news you want or the location you're interested in.<br>
		7. It is quite simple, the tabs make it easy.<br>
		8. Informed.

		<a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/"><strong>The Atlantic</strong></a><br>
		1. I like The Atlantic because it provides intelligent, measured editorials that provide interesting takes on current events, science, and culture.<br>
		2. The most obvious answer is the slideshow. It's the biggest item and has enough movement that it draws your eye.<br>
		3. Bold, stylish, sleek, contemporary, engaging.<br>
		4. This website provides measured analysis with a slight leftward slant.<br>
		5. Interesting, outside-the-box, interesting, entertaining, fun.<br>
		6. Very easy to find something interesting, but I actually think it's tabs could be better organized; they are too general.<br>
		7. I can spend a lot of time on the website without tiring, but my biggest critique is that it's easy to read everything new in a short period of time.<br>
		8. It does not.

		<p class="paragraph">
		<a href="http://www.reddit.com/"><strong>Reddit</strong></a><br>
		1. Reddit is fun to waste time and relax on, because there is an endless supply of new and diverse content.<br>
		2. To be honest I think it is quite poorly designed. There's not one thing my eye is drawn to, I'm mostly drawn to the list of content.<br>
		3. No-frills, utilitarian, straightforward, bland, overwhelming.<br>
		4. News agregation for the lazy.<br>
		5. Depends what sub. Whimsical, interesting, beautiful, disturbing, thought provoking.<br>
		6. Actually quite hard. It excels at providing an endless feed of random new content. There's a fairly steep (but rewarding) learning curve for customizing your experience delving into the many subreddits, and the search function is nearly useless.<br>
		7. Mostly like I wasted a lot of time. I'm seldom glad I spent so much time on it.<br>
		8. It sells memorabilia and "reddit gold." I've never bought either.
