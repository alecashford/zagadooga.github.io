		<STRONG>Exercise 2</STRONG><br>
		<STRONG>Movement.</STRONG> I associate movement, not with physical movement through space, but with the sense of continuous personal development. Something I have noticed over the years is that I am happiest when I feel like I am "going somewhere" in life and unhappiest when I feel like I am stagnating, or standing still. I use the word movement to mean this kind of sensation, the feeling of consistently moving towards a goal, no matter what it is, and no matter how slowly. As long as I feel like I'm moving, and not stagnating, I tend to be happy.<br><br>

		<STRONG>Exercise 3</STRONG><br>
		I chose 4. Because In general I always try to live up to my personal values, but I know that I get into "ruts" in life where it feels easiest not to. Thankfully I always seem to be able to pull myself out of these.<br><br>

		<STRONG>Exercise 4</STRONG><br>
		Career advice. A friend of mine, who works two part time jobs, asked me if they should quit one that offered more hours and stability but less opportunity for advancement, to focus on the one that she found more personally gratifying and had more potential, but offered fewer hours.
