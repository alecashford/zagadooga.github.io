			My name is Alec Ashford. I'm 23 years old and live in Oakland. A year ago I graduated from Willamette University in Salem, OR, with a B.A. in history. Since then I've been working in a small architecture in West Oakland as a design assistant and the head of their IT. It was there that I was first exposed to coding and website design, as I was responsible for administrating their main website and building an entirely new one for a side project of theirs.
		</p><br>
		<p>
			I've been coding on my own, teaching myself python, javascript, and now ruby. I don't claim to be an expert but I'm ready to learn and very excited for what this new path has in store for me!
