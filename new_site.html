			I have many values that are important to me, so instead of going back over each one, I’ll meditate on one, and then talk a bit about my planned strategies for what I can if I’m feeling down at DBC. First, I am big on respect. I want to be respected, and I want to respect other people. It is a drive that motivates a lot of what I do. I want to put forward competent, quality work that is worthy of respect, so sometimes I spend too much time on a simple project, or beat myself up too much over one mistake. In a way it is a reaction borne out of insecurity; I want validation on some level, and I want that other person to be impressed with what I have to offer. This can drive me to do incredible things, but it can also prevent me from taking bold risks.<br><br>

			Because I have these needs of my own, I’m also very conscious of other people having their own needs that need to be fulfilled. That is where my respect of them comes in. My default setting is to respect someone unless they do something outrageous that would cause me to lose my respect for them. I believe that a big thing that drives a lot of people is the desire for respect and validation—it’s true for me, and I assume it’s true of others. That’s why, whenever I can, I try to treat others like I would like to be treated. It has worked pretty well for me so far.<br><br>

			This sort of relates to what I plan to do if I feel down at DBC. It is possible that, at a certain point, I will lose respect for myself temporarily because I feel inadequate or like I am not as good as my peers. When this happens, I plan to talk to my peers and see if they are feeling the same thing. Oftentimes, just the fact that another person is going through the same thing is enough to help you out of a dark place.<br><br>
